# Student Registration System Application

**Author:** Timothy Mok

## Summary
The objective of this project was to create a GUI-based application that students at the univeristy could use to register in courses. Any name and ID is allowed during the login process and the main menu allows the users to register for courses, remove courses, view their currently registered courses, lookup a course in the catalogue and view all courses in the catalogue. The frontend of the web application was developed using Swing and the application was created before connection to a database was learned. 

*This project was completed as part of ENSF 607: Advanced Software Design and Architecture.*
